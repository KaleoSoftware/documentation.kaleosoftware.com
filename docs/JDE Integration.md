# JDE Integration

Kaleo can be accessed via the Related Information / Composite Application Framework available in JDE Tools 9.1.

## Configuration

Follow these steps to configure JDE Application Pages to display Kaleo.

## Publication Lists

First, we need to create a Publication List that layouts can be published out to.

![](/images/jde-publication-lists-2.jpg)

## Enable RIA for Each JDE Application

Go to JDE App P952332 and create a record for the JDE Form that you want to add Kaleo to:

![](/images/jde-enable-ria.jpg)

## Create a new Layout

Now, go to the Form that you want to add Kaleo to, and you will see an Edit Current Page menu item

![](/images/jde-create-layout-1.jpg)

Now follow these steps to add Kaleo to a new Layout

![](/images/jde-create-layout-2.jpg)

![](/images/jde-create-layout-3.jpg)

![](/images/jde-create-layout-4.jpg)

![](/images/jde-create-layout-5.jpg)

![](/images/jde-create-layout-6.jpg)

This Layout is now published to all Users/Roles you specified earlier in the Publication List.
